                <h2> Zaanse Schans </h2>
                <p> One of the most famous attractions in Zaandam is the Zaanse Schans. As a short history for this place, Zaanse Schans is best known for its collection of windmills and wooden houses. At the Zaanse Schans you can find 5 working windmills, some of which are open to visit. These windmills perform different tasks, such as sawing wood, milling oil and grinding flour, spices and pigments in the same way they did twohundred years ago. When a windmill is open for visit, you can walk through the interior and take the rickety stairs all the way to the top deck, where you have to be careful not being hit by one of the sails! </p>
